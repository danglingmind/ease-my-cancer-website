                  Hi, I'm Parul.
                </h2>
                <p className="text-xl text-muted-foreground">
                  When my mother was diagnosed with cancer, I became her primary caregiver and a silent witness to her everyday struggles.
                </p>
              </div>

              <Card className="bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-sm border-0 shadow-lg">
                <CardContent className="p-6">
                  <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                    <p>
                      The fear she carried quietly, the fatigue, the endless questions no one seemed to have the time to answer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I realized that while doctors fought bravely for her life, so much more was left unseen and unsaid, the emotional battles, the loss of strength, the isolation; And as her caregiver, I too carried a weight that often felt invisible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It was during those moments that I made a promise to myself: <strong className="text-primary">no one should have to go through this journey alone.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      EaseMyCancer was born out of that promise, to create a safe space of support, healing, and strength, not just for patients but also for the ones who stand by them. Because cancer care is not only about surviving treatment, but about living fully with dignity, hope, and compassion.
